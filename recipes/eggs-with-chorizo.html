    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6-8 eggs</li>
        <li>1 chorizo sausage</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1/4 diced white onion</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Start by heating a stainless steel/cast iron pan to medium heat.
            Add your olive oil.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once heated, throw in the diced onions until nearly carmelized.
        </li>
        <li>
            Toss the entire chorizo sausage and break it up in the pan. Make
            sure the chorizo is almost entirely brown.
        </li>
        <li>
            Finally, crack your eggs into the pan and fully cook. You can 
            optionally scramble your eggs if you like.
        </li>
        <li>
            You shouldn't worry about seasoning since the chorizo has plenty of
            spices but you can add salt and pepper to enhance the flavor.
        </li>
    </ol>
