# odin-recipes
A simple HTML-only webpage that holds links to recipes. First project of TOP.

In this project, I built a webpage holding Mexican breakfast recipes. Firstly,
I started off with the index.html, the must-have starting point of every
webpage, and used anchor tags to hold the path for each recipe page with href.
Then, I created a page for each recipe using image, header, paragraph, and
list tags.
